This is a fork of the Infinity-Cube project by [s-marlex](https://github.com/s-marley/Infinity-Cube) (or see below)

In my project, there are a few things changed.

# 1. The included 3D-Printfiles are scaled to 171x171x171mm
- This allows them to be printed perfectly on a Prusa Mini or a Bambulab A1 Mini
![PrintPlate-View](./Images/3D-Preview.png)
- The needed mirrors are exactly 150x150mm, which is easier to buy
- The grow in size should allow the use of standard 144LED/m Strips that are much more cheaper than the original ones
  (e.g. https://de.aliexpress.com/item/2036819167.html )
  This results in 20LEDs per Strut
- The standard LED-Strips provide a "natural" seal for the mirrors an hopefully hold them in place automatically
- I extended the Base, to create place for the controller-electronics (was a separate Box in the the original project)
# 2. The Cube is no longer cut in half, instead the top is alone and the struts are complete at the bottom part
- I hope this will make the assembly easier.
# 3. Instead of creating a custom binary for the electroics I use standard (WLED)[https://kno.wled.ge/]
